# Simple Register Model
Simple Register Model (srm) are system verilog classes that help to develop register model (aka regstore, register abstraction layer) for [uvm testbenches](http://accellera.org/downloads/standards/uvm).  

It is open sourced and available under MIT license.  

It is designed to be used in uvm testbenches instead of the *uvm_reg* package that is shipped with uvm distribution.  

The intended users of the package are design verificatipn (DV) engineers involved in developing uvm testbneches and writing uvm sequences for verifying the design.

## Getting the Distribution
Easiest way to get started with srm is to download the tar file from the [release area](https://github.com/Juniper/simple_reg_model/releases) and follow the setup instructions. Srm docuementation can be found [here](https://github.com/Juniper/simple_reg_model/wiki).
